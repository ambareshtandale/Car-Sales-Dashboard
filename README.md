# Car-Sales-Dashboard
This dashboard is a Car Sales Performance Dashboard created in Power BI (or similar tool). It is designed to track and visualize key sales insights for automobiles. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of what it shows:

ðŸ”¹ Top KPIs (Key Metrics)
746K â†’ Total number of sales.
21.4% â†’ Growth rate compared to the previous period.
614K â†’ Pre-sales leads or pipeline count.
473K â†’ Market size or active customers reached.

ðŸ”¹ Main Visualization
A car image is displayed in the center, making it a visually engaging dashboard for automotive sales.

ðŸ”¹ Breakdowns
Replacement, Servicing, Other â†’ Breakdown of sales/service categories.
Sale Type (Pie Chart) â†’ Distribution of sales types such as Post-Purchase, Direct Sale, or On the Book.
Monthly Sales Trend (Bar Graph) â†’ Sales performance month by month (Janâ€“Dec), useful for identifying seasonality or sales peaks.

ðŸ”¹ Filters & Navigation
Year filters (2019â€“2023) at the top to analyze different periods.
Tabs at the bottom (Car 1, Car 2, Car 3) suggest comparisons across multiple models.

At the top, the dashboard highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales (746K), sales growth rate (21.4%), pre-sales opportunities (614K), and the market reach (473K). These KPIs allow stakeholders to instantly track business performance against sales goals and industry benchmarks.

The central visualization incorporates a vehicle image to make the dashboard intuitive and engaging for the automotive industry. Alongside this, sales are further categorized into Replacement, Servicing, and Other segments, which provide a clear understanding of revenue sources. A donut chart represents the proportion of different sales types, including post-purchase sales, direct sales, and on-the-book sales, helping identify which channels contribute most to overall performance.

The dashboard also includes a monthly trend analysis shown through bar graphs from January to December, enabling users to identify seasonality, peak months, and performance dips. Additionally, year-based filters (2019â€“2023) allow for historical comparisons, while navigation tabs (Car 1, Car 2, Car 3) enable users to drill down and compare multiple car models individually.

Overall, this project demonstrates strong skills in data cleaning, modeling, DAX calculations, and visualization design within Power BI. It emphasizes the importance of combining clear KPIs with interactive filters and engaging visuals to create a user-friendly decision-support system. This dashboard can be extended further by integrating customer demographics, regional sales data, or predictive analytics
